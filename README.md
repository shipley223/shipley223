There is a popular saying in Zen Buddhism:
Before one studies Zen, mountains are mountains and waters are waters; 
After a first glimpse into the truth of Zen, mountains are no longer mountains and waters are no longer waters;
After enlightenment, mountains are once again mountains and waters once again waters.
